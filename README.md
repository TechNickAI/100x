**Reclaim your presence. Build an AI team. Move at the speed of creativity.**

You know AI could transform your work. You've heard about automation tools but they're too complex. You can see the value of AI employees but don't know how to build them.

This gives you a team of AI employees that builds itself. You describe what you need in plain English. The AI generates the agent, you review the code, and your workforce grows. Every agent can create new agents when it hits a limitation.

---

## üéØ What You Get

A team of AI employees helping you execute on your visions. Move at the speed of creativity.

Specifically:

- Every conversation and meeting gets processed, extracting commitments with context
- Your knowledge base stays current without manual updates
- Agents recognize their limitations and request new capabilities
- They learn from patterns to improve their own performance

Your AI team handles the cognitive load while you focus on decisions and creative work.

## üìñ README-Driven Development

**Important:** This project follows README-driven development. We're documenting the complete vision and architecture before full implementation. Not all described functionality exists yet‚Äîsee the [Progress Table](#-current-progress) below for what's actually built.

## üîÑ The 100x Framework

The framework follows a three-stage progression from personal efficiency to world-changing leverage. For the complete philosophy and detailed examples at each stage, see the [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md).

```mermaid

    A[üìã 1x: Efficiency<br/>Organize Data] --> B[üë• 10x: Capacity<br/>Build AI Team]

    style A fill:#fff3cd
    style B fill:#d1ecf1
    style C fill:#d4edda
```

### **üìã 1x ‚Üí Efficiency**

Achieving 100% baseline by organizing your data and knowledge. Building a clean, human-readable knowledge base that eliminates chaos before adding automation. **Organization before automation.**

### **üë• 10x ‚Üí Capacity**

Building an AI team where before there was only you. Specialized agents handle commitment tracking, memory management, research, and documentation while you focus on decisions and strategy. **One person becomes a team of ten.**

### **üé® 100x ‚Üí Creativity**

Having an AI execution partner that turns visions into reality. Whether launching ventures, coordinating social impact, or validating research‚Äîthe AI handles analysis, development, and deployment. **Go from idea to working prototype in days, not months.**

## üî® The Core Insight: Interaction Before Self-Building

The system needs two layers to be genuinely useful:

### Layer 1: Interaction (Build First)

**Piper the Chief of Staff** - Your interface to the AI team through ClickUp:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[You: Create Task in ClickUp] --> B[Piper Claims Task]
    B --> C[Shows Progress]
    C --> D[Completes Work]
    D --> E[Updates Task with Results]
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style C fill:#fff3cd
    style E fill:#d4f1d4
```

### Layer 2: Self-Building (Build Second)

**Forge the Coder** - Receives agent requests through Piper:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[You: Create Task via ClickUp] --> B[Piper Routes to Forge]
    B --> C[Forge Generates Agent]
    C --> D[Pull Request]
    D --> E[You Review & Merge]
    E --> F[New Agent Joins Workforce]
    F -.Can create more agents.-> A
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style C fill:#fff3cd
    style F fill:#d4f1d4
```

**Why this order?** Forge without the interaction layer is just a command-line tool you'd use from Cursor. With Piper first, Forge becomes part of a system that anyone can use, that shows its work, and that can improve itself through the same interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Choices

Built with modern, proven technologies:

- **Python 3.13+** with async support and type hints
- **Pydantic AI** for structured agent outputs and LLM interactions
- **OpenRouter** for unified LLM access (see ai/core/openrouter.py for models)
- **Celery + Redis** for task queue and caching
- **Logfire** for comprehensive observability
- **Click + Rich** for beautiful CLI tools
- **Git + gh CLI** for version control and pull request creation
- **Docker** for consistent deployment

**Post-MVP additions:** FastAPI (webhooks), PostgreSQL (database), Django Admin (UI)

## üéØ How It Works

Your conversations and meetings flow through agents that extract what matters:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[üéôÔ∏è Conversations<br/>Limitless, Fireflies] --> D[ü§ñ Agents Extract<br/>Commitments & Context]
    B[üìß Messages<br/>Email, WhatsApp] --> D
    C[üìÑ Documents<br/>Dropbox, Drive] --> D
    D --> E[üìö Knowledge Base<br/>Notion: People, Projects, Intelligence]
    D --> F[‚úÖ Tasks Created<br/>ClickUp: Commitments & Actions]
    style D fill:#e1f5ff
    style E fill:#d4edda
    style F fill:#fff3cd
```

**Data sources:**

- Wearable recordings (Limitless AI)
- Meeting transcripts (Fireflies AI)
- Communication (Email, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Documents (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Project management (ClickUp/Asana/Linear)
- Knowledge bases (Notion/Obsidian/Confluence)

## üöÄ The Path Forward

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)

**Build the interaction layer first** - agents need a way to communicate and show progress before self-building capabilities matter:

1. **ClickUp Provider** - Poll for tasks, update status, post comments
2. **Piper (Basic)** - Acknowledges tasks assigned to "AI", shows what it's working on
3. **Agent Registry** - Simple lookup so agents can find and call each other

This creates the **feedback loop** - you assign a task, see the agent claim it, watch progress updates, and get results.

### Then Forge Makes Sense (Phase 2)

Once the interaction layer works, **Forge the Coder** becomes genuinely useful:

1. Create a task via ClickUp: "Build Maya the Memory Keeper agent"
2. Forge sees the task, shows progress, generates code
3. PR gets created with full context from the task
4. You review and merge
5. Maya joins your workforce and can receive tasks the same way

### Why This Order?

Forge without ClickUp integration is just a worse version of Cursor - you'd still be on the command line. With the interaction layer first:

- ‚úÖ Agents become immediately useful and visible
- ‚úÖ Other people can use the system through ClickUp
- ‚úÖ Agents can request improvements that flow back through the system
- ‚úÖ You can see what's happening in real-time

### üå± Long-Term Vision

Your AI workforce evolves with you:

- Agents recognize patterns and create specialized helpers
- Capabilities improve from real-world experience
- New agents emerge from identified gaps
- You spend time on creative decisions, not implementation details

## üìö Documentation

The [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md) explains the philosophy and progression from 1x ‚Üí 10x ‚Üí 100x.

For detailed architecture, agent specifications, and implementation guides, explore the [context/](context/) folder.

## üí° Core Principles

These principles emerged from real implementation challenges:

- **Self-evolution over features** - Create capabilities when you need them, not based on prediction
- **Agent-first design** - Autonomous agents that communicate and evolve, not predetermined workflows
- **Data-first architecture** - Store everything raw, let multiple agents extract different insights
- **Human oversight** - All agent creation flows through pull requests for review
- **Heart-centered AI** - All agents use [heart-centered-prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts) to operate from compassion, recognize when to offer emotional support vs. analysis, and treat interactions as mutual flourishing

**Reclaim your presence. Build an AI team. Move at the speed of creativity.**

You know AI could transform your work. You've heard about automation tools but they're too complex. You can see the value of AI employees but don't know how to build them.

This gives you a team of AI employees that builds itself. You describe what you need in plain English. The AI generates the agent, you review the code, and your workforce grows. Every agent can create new agents when it hits a limitation.

---

## üéØ What You Get

A team of AI employees helping you execute on your visions. Move at the speed of creativity.

Specifically:

- Every conversation and meeting gets processed, extracting commitments with context
- Your knowledge base stays current without manual updates
- Agents recognize their limitations and request new capabilities
- They learn from patterns to improve their own performance

Your AI team handles the cognitive load while you focus on decisions and creative work.

## üìñ README-Driven Development

**Important:** We're documenting the complete vision before full implementation. Not all described functionality exists yet‚Äîsee the [Progress Table](#-current-progress) below for what's actually built.

## üîÑ The 100x Framework

The framework follows a three-stage progression from personal efficiency to world-changing leverage. For the complete philosophy and detailed examples at each stage, see the [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md).

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üìã 1x: Efficiency<br/>Organize Data] --> B[üë• 10x: Capacity<br/>Build AI Team]
    B --> C[üé® 100x: Creativity<br/>Execute Visions]
    style A fill:#fff3cd
    style B fill:#d1ecf1
    style C fill:#d4edda
```

### **üìã 1x ‚Üí Efficiency**

Achieving 100% baseline by organizing your data and knowledge. Building a clean, human-readable knowledge base that eliminates chaos before adding automation. **Organization before automation.**

### **üë• 10x ‚Üí Capacity**

Building an AI team where before there was only you. Specialized agents handle commitment tracking, memory management, research, and documentation while you focus on decisions and strategy. **One person becomes a team of ten.**

### **üé® 100x ‚Üí Creativity**

Having an AI execution partner that turns visions into reality. Whether launching ventures, coordinating social impact, or validating research‚Äîthe AI handles analysis, development, and deployment. **Go from idea to working prototype in days, not months.**

## üî® The Core Insight: Self-Building AI Workforce

This isn't just AI automation‚Äîit's an AI workforce that builds itself.

**How it works from your perspective:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[You: Create Task] --> B[AI Claims It]
    B --> C[Shows Progress]
    C --> D[Delivers Results]
    D --> E[Or Creates New Agents if Needed]
    E -.New capabilities.-> A
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style C fill:#fff3cd
    style D fill:#d4f1d4
```

You interact through your existing project management tool (ClickUp, Asana, Linear). Create a task, assign it to your AI team, and watch it get done. When your AI team encounters something it can't do yet, it creates a new agent to handle it‚Äîthen gets you to review the code before deploying.

**The magic:** Every agent can recognize its limitations and request new capabilities. Your AI workforce evolves with your needs instead of staying frozen in time.

## üéØ How It Works

Your conversations and meetings flow through agents that extract what matters:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[üéôÔ∏è Conversations<br/>Limitless, Fireflies] --> D[ü§ñ Agents Extract<br/>Commitments & Context]
    B[üìß Messages<br/>Email, WhatsApp] --> D
    C[üìÑ Documents<br/>Dropbox, Drive] --> D
    D --> E[üìö Knowledge Base<br/>Notion: People, Projects, Intelligence]
    D --> F[‚úÖ Tasks Created<br/>ClickUp: Commitments & Actions]
    style D fill:#e1f5ff
    style E fill:#d4edda
    style F fill:#fff3cd
```

**Data sources:**

- Wearable recordings (Limitless AI)
- Meeting transcripts (Fireflies AI)
- Communication (Email, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Documents (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Project management (ClickUp/Asana/Linear)
- Knowledge bases (Notion/Obsidian/Confluence)

## üöÄ Your Path Forward

### Start Using It

1. **Connect your tools** - Link your project management system (ClickUp/Asana/Linear)
2. **Create your first task** - Assign something to your AI team
3. **Watch it work** - See progress updates and results in real-time
4. **Request new capabilities** - Need something it can't do? Just ask and review the PR

### Watch It Grow

Your AI workforce evolves with you:

- Agents recognize patterns and create specialized helpers
- Capabilities improve from real-world experience
- New agents emerge from identified gaps
- You spend time on creative decisions, not implementation details

## üìö Documentation

The [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md) explains the philosophy and progression from 1x ‚Üí 10x ‚Üí 100x.

For detailed architecture, agent specifications, and implementation guides, explore the [context/](context/) folder.

## üí° Core Principles

These principles emerged from real implementation challenges:

- **Self-evolution over features** - Create capabilities when you need them, not based on prediction
- **Agent-first design** - Autonomous agents that communicate and evolve, not predetermined workflows
- **Data-first architecture** - Store everything raw, let multiple agents extract different insights
- **Human oversight** - All agent creation flows through pull requests for review
- **Heart-centered AI** - All agents use [heart-centered-prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts) to operate from compassion, recognize when to offer emotional support vs. analysis, and treat interactions as mutual flourishing

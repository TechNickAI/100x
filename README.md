**Reclaim your presence. Build an AI team. Move at the speed of creativity.**

You know AI could transform your work. You've heard about automation tools but they're too complex. You can see the value of AI employees but don't know how to build them.

This gives you a team of AI employees that builds itself. You describe what you need in plain English. The AI generates the agent, you review the code, and your workforce grows. Every agent can create new agents when it hits a limitation.

---

## üéØ What You Get

A team of AI employees helping you execute on your visions. Move at the speed of creativity.

Specifically:

- Every conversation and meeting gets processed, extracting commitments with context
- Your knowledge base stays current without manual updates
- Agents recognize their limitations and request new capabilities
- They learn from patterns to improve their own performance

Your AI team handles the cognitive load while you focus on decisions and creative work.

## üìñ README-Driven Development

**Important:** This project follows README-driven development. We're documenting the complete vision and architecture before full implementation. Not all described functionality exists yet‚Äîsee the [Progress Table](#-current-progress) below for what's actually built.

## üîÑ The 100x Framework

The framework follows a three-stage progression from personal efficiency to world-changing leverage. For the complete philosophy and detailed examples at each stage, see the [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md).

    style A fill:#fff3cd
    style B fill:#d1ecf1
    style C fill:#d4edda
```

### **üìã 1x ‚Üí Efficiency**

Achieving 100% baseline by organizing your data and knowledge. Building a clean, human-readable knowledge base that eliminates chaos before adding automation. **Organization before automation.**

### **üë• 10x ‚Üí Capacity**

Building an AI team where before there was only you. Specialized agents handle commitment tracking, memory management, research, and documentation while you focus on decisions and strategy. **One person becomes a team of ten.**

### **üé® 100x ‚Üí Creativity**

Having an AI execution partner that turns visions into reality. Whether launching ventures, coordinating social impact, or validating research‚Äîthe AI handles analysis, development, and deployment. **Go from idea to working prototype in days, not months.**

## üî® The Core Insight: Forge the Coder

Everything starts with one agent: **Forge the Coder**.

You build Forge manually. Then Forge builds everything else.

1. You build Forge once (the only agent you create by hand)
2. Forge builds all other agents from natural language descriptions
3. Agents recognize their limitations and request improvements
4. Your workforce evolves to meet emerging needs

The workflow:

```mermaid

    A[You: Create Task] --> B[Forge Generates Agent]

    C --> D[You Review & Merge]
    D --> E[New Agent Joins Workforce]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Choices

Built with modern, proven technologies:

- **Python 3.13+** with async support and type hints
- **Pydantic AI** for structured agent outputs and LLM interactions
- **OpenRouter** for unified LLM access (see ai/core/openrouter.py for models)
- **Celery + Redis** for task queue and caching
- **Logfire** for comprehensive observability
- **Click + Rich** for beautiful CLI tools
- **Git + gh CLI** for version control and pull request creation
- **Docker** for consistent deployment

**Post-MVP additions:** FastAPI (webhooks), PostgreSQL (database), Django Admin (UI)

## üéØ How It Works

Your conversations and meetings flow through agents that extract what matters:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[üéôÔ∏è Conversations<br/>Limitless, Fireflies] --> D[ü§ñ Agents Extract<br/>Commitments & Context]
    B[üìß Messages<br/>Email, WhatsApp] --> D
    C[üìÑ Documents<br/>Dropbox, Drive] --> D
    D --> E[üìö Knowledge Base<br/>Notion: People, Projects, Intelligence]
    D --> F[‚úÖ Tasks Created<br/>ClickUp: Commitments & Actions]
    style D fill:#e1f5ff
    style E fill:#d4edda
    style F fill:#fff3cd
```

**Data sources:**

- Wearable recordings (Limitless AI)
- Meeting transcripts (Fireflies AI)
- Communication (Email, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Documents (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Project management (ClickUp/Asana/Linear)
- Knowledge bases (Notion/Obsidian/Confluence)

## üöÄ The Path Forward

### Immediate Next Step

Build Forge the Coder‚Äîthe only agent you'll build manually. Everything else gets built by Forge through natural language task descriptions.

### Then What?

Once Forge works:

1. Create a task: "Build Maya the Memory Keeper agent"
2. Forge generates the code
3. Review the PR
4. Maya joins your workforce
5. Repeat for each needed capability

### üå± Long-Term Vision

Your AI workforce evolves with you:

- Agents recognize patterns and create specialized helpers
- Capabilities improve from real-world experience
- New agents emerge from identified gaps
- You spend time on creative decisions, not implementation details

## üìö Documentation

The [100x Framework](context/100x-framework.md) explains the philosophy and progression from 1x ‚Üí 10x ‚Üí 100x.

For detailed architecture, agent specifications, and implementation guides, explore the [context/](context/) folder.

## üí° Core Principles

These principles emerged from real implementation challenges:

- **Self-evolution over features** - Create capabilities when you need them, not based on prediction
- **Agent-first design** - Autonomous agents that communicate and evolve, not predetermined workflows
- **Data-first architecture** - Store everything raw, let multiple agents extract different insights
- **Human oversight** - All agent creation flows through pull requests for review
- **Heart-centered AI** - All agents use [heart-centered-prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts) to operate from compassion, recognize when to offer emotional support vs. analysis, and treat interactions as mutual flourishing

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an open-source foundation for autonomous AI systems. We welcome contributions that align with the vision of self-evolving, human-amplifying AI.

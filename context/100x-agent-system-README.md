## Project Overview

### Vision and Philosophy

The 100x Agent System represents a fundamental shift in how personal AI assistants operate. This system creates intelligent agents that understand their own limitations and evolve to meet emerging needs. The core insight: the most valuable AI system recognizes when it needs new capabilities and creates them.

Traditional automation focuses on "figuring out what's robotic and automating it." This system captures, organizes, and actions the implications of ever-evolving human creativity. It amplifies human capability by a factor of 100x by enabling entirely new categories of work and thought.

### The 100x Framework

This system implements the 100x Framework - a three-stage progression from personal efficiency to world-changing leverage:

**1x (Efficiency)** - Achieving 100% baseline by organizing your data and knowledge. Building a clean, human-readable knowledge base that eliminates chaos before adding automation. Organization before automation.

**10x (Capacity)** - Building an AI team where before there was only you. Specialized agents handle commitment tracking, memory management, research, documentation, and privacy while you focus on decisions and strategy. One person becomes a team of ten.

**100x (Creativity)** - Having an AI execution partner that turns visions into reality. Whether launching ventures, coordinating social impact initiatives, or validating research - the AI handles analysis, development, simulation, and deployment. The barrier between imagining something important and executing on it dissolves.

For a complete understanding of this progression and why each stage matters, see the [100x Framework document](100x-framework.md). The framework explains the philosophy and expected outcomes at each level, while this document provides the technical architecture to build it.

### Core Value Proposition

The system addresses three fundamental challenges that prevent busy executives and knowledge workers from leveraging AI effectively:

First, there's the expertise gap. Many professionals know AI could transform their work but lack the technical knowledge or time to implement it. They understand conceptually that AI should help with meeting transcripts, commitment tracking, and knowledge management, but the path from concept to implementation remains opaque.

Second, there's the integration challenge. Valuable data lives scattered across platforms - meeting recordings in Fireflies, personal notes in Limitless, documentation in Notion, tasks in ClickUp. Current solutions require manual export, transformation, and import cycles that break down quickly under real-world pressure.

Third, there's the evolution problem. Static systems, no matter how well-designed initially, inevitably hit limitations. When a new use case emerges or a workflow needs adjustment, traditional systems require developer intervention. This creates bottlenecks and prevents the rapid iteration that AI-first workflows demand.

### Target Capabilities

The system's ultimate goal is to provide every user with an AI workforce that rivals what billionaires achieve through human staff. This means agents that can:

Process every conversation and meeting in real-time, extracting action items while understanding context, subtext, and strategic implications. When you mention considering a new partnership in passing during a call, the system recognizes this as strategic information and updates relevant project contexts automatically.

Maintain a living knowledge base that evolves with every interaction. Traditional documentation goes stale the moment it's written. This system continuously updates its understanding of projects, relationships, and commitments. Ask about any initiative's status, and it knows both what was formally documented and what was discussed yesterday afternoon.

Generate new capabilities on demand. When you describe a new type of analysis you need or a workflow you want to implement, the system doesn't just add it to a feature request list - it creates the agent to handle it. This self-evolution happens through natural language, making sophisticated AI accessible to non-technical users.

The system improves itself. When an agent fails to complete a task or recognizes a pattern of similar requests, it analyzes what capability it's missing, writes a specification for that capability, and creates or modifies agents to address the gap. This creates a compounding effect where the system becomes more capable with use instead of more brittle.

## Implementation Guidance

### For AI Implementation Platforms

If you're an AI coding assistant implementing this system, read this carefully:

**Your first and only manual deliverable is Forge the Coder.**

Do not build Maya, Sarah, Winston, or any other agent by hand. Do not try to implement the full system in one go. Build Forge first. Once Forge works, you use Forge to build everything else by creating tasks in natural language.

**User Interaction for MVP:** The system has two interfaces for MVP:

1. **ClickUp** - Primary interface for regular users. Create tasks assigned to "AI", receive responses via comments and updates.
2. **CLI** - Power user interface for developers and administrators. Run agents on demand, validate configurations, check system health. Built with `click` for clean command organization.

Additional interfaces (WhatsApp, Telegram, web chat) will be added in later phases.

See [Phase 0: Forge the Coder](#phase-0-forge-the-coder-first-deliverable) for detailed requirements and [CLI Interface](#cli-interface) for command-line capabilities.

### Platform Flexibility

This architecture uses Notion as the reference knowledge base and ClickUp as the reference project management system. These are architectural choices, not requirements. If you prefer different platforms (Obsidian, Confluence, Asana, Linear, etc.), the patterns remain the same - implement provider connectors for your chosen tools. The core architecture is platform-agnostic.

## Getting Data Into AI

If 2024 was the year of agents, 2025 is the year of getting data into AI. Agents are only as effective as the data they can access. This system captures data from all sources - wearable audio, meeting transcripts, chat logs, email, files, and social media - and ingests it automatically through dedicated agents that extract facts, commitments, and context.

The strategy follows three principles: record everything continuously, ingest automatically without manual intervention, and use agent-first processing to filter signal from noise. Start with one data source and the human-readable knowledge base, adding complexity only when needed.

For the complete data ingestion strategy including continuous ingestion patterns, privacy controls, and success metrics, see the [Data Ingestion Strategy document](data-ingestion-strategy.md).

---

## Core Architecture

### Foundational Principles

**Self-Evolution First** - Every agent is designed to improve itself. When an agent recognizes a limitation or repeated pattern, it creates a task for Forge describing the needed enhancement. The system continuously evolves toward greater capability.

**Data-First Architecture** - Store everything raw first, process later. Multiple agents can process the same data for different purposes. Idempotent processing allows reprocessing historical data when agents improve. Raw transcripts, complete documents, and unedited conversations remain accessible even after summarization.

**Agent-First Design** - The architecture abandons traditional workflow-centric thinking in favor of autonomous agents that communicate, collaborate, and evolve. Each agent is a complete, self-contained unit with its own context, capabilities, and improvement mechanisms.

### Agent-First Design Principles

The architecture draws inspiration from biological systems where simple organisms with basic rules create complex emergent behaviors through interaction.

Agents are not mere execution units following scripts. Each agent maintains its own state, understands its purpose, can explain its actions, and most importantly, can recognize when it needs help or new capabilities. When an agent encounters a task outside its current abilities, it doesn't fail silently or throw an error - it articulates what it needs and either requests help from other agents or initiates the creation of new capabilities.

The system embraces eventual consistency over rigid synchronization. Agents work asynchronously, processing information as it becomes available and updating shared knowledge bases without blocking operations. This allows the system to remain responsive even when handling complex, multi-step operations across multiple external services.

### Provider Abstraction Layer

The system implements a provider abstraction that treats all external AI services as pluggable components. Whether querying Limitless for yesterday's commitments, extracting meeting insights from Fireflies, or updating documentation in Notion, the interface remains consistent.

Each provider exposes capabilities through a standardized interface:

- Query methods for retrieving information
- Update methods for writing back processed data
- Streaming methods for real-time data ingestion
- Authentication handling that supports multiple credential types

This abstraction enables several critical features. Providers can be swapped without rewriting agents - switch from Fireflies to another meeting platform and agents continue functioning. New providers can be added through configuration. Agents can discover and utilize provider capabilities dynamically, choosing the best tool for each task.

The provider layer also handles the complexity of rate limiting, retry logic, and error recovery. Agents make requests without worrying about transient failures or API limitations. The provider layer queues requests, manages backoff strategies, and ensures eventual delivery of critical updates.

### System Inputs

The system ingests information through multiple channels, each triggering different agent behaviors:

**Passive Data Collection** - Background ingestion of recorded data:

- **Limitless AI**: Personal conversations and daily interactions from wearable recordings
- **Fireflies AI**: Formal meetings with structured agendas and multiple participants
- **Email monitoring**: Inbox scanning for commitments, important messages, and actionable items
- These sources run on scheduled intervals (hourly, daily) processing new content automatically

**Active User Interaction** - Direct communication with the agent system:

- **ClickUp tasks**: MVP interface - create tasks assigned to "AI", receive responses via comments and updates
- **WhatsApp messages**: Future - conversing with Piper the Chief of Staff
- **Telegram messages**: Future - alternative messaging platform for agent interaction
- **SMS**: Future - text-based quick requests and updates
- **iMessage**: Future (challenging to implement server-side but desirable if feasible)
- **Web chat**: Future - browser-based chat interface

**Social Media Monitoring** - Communication channels that may contain actionable content:

- **Facebook Messenger**: Personal and business conversations
- **Instagram DMs**: Creator and business relationships
- **LinkedIn messages**: Professional networking and opportunities
- **Twitter/X DMs**: Quick interactions and networking
- Monitoring frequency depends on usage patterns and importance

**Voice Commands** - Spoken input for hands-free operation:

- "Piper, delete the last 5 minutes" (privacy protection via Winston)
- "What's on my calendar tomorrow?" (schedule queries)
- "Remind me to follow up with Sarah next week" (commitment creation)
- Integration with phone systems or voice assistants

**Input Routing Architecture:**

Different input types trigger different agents directly based on their nature:

- **Messaging platforms** (WhatsApp, Telegram) → Piper the Chief of Staff handles user conversations
- **Email monitoring** → Dedicated email processing agent analyzes and routes
- **Limitless/Fireflies** → Maya the Memory Keeper processes automatically
- **Social media** → Platform-specific monitoring agents handle their domains

Piper serves as the primary conversational interface for humans, while other agents handle background data ingestion autonomously.

### Memory and Context Management

**Knowledge Base Architecture**

The system uses Notion as the primary knowledge base - the trusted source of structured knowledge. Rather than building a separate RAG database upfront, the system queries Notion directly and uses the relevant pages as context for LLM operations. This approach keeps the knowledge base human-readable, auditable, and maintainable.

**Note:** Notion is the reference implementation. If you prefer a different knowledge base (Obsidian, Roam, Confluence, etc.), the same patterns apply - build a provider connector for your chosen platform. The architecture remains the same: query your knowledge base directly for context.

When an agent needs context:

1. Query Notion databases for relevant entities (people, projects, resources)
2. Retrieve the full page content for those entities
3. Include that content in the LLM prompt as context
4. Let the LLM's native understanding work with the structured Notion data

This architecture prioritizes transparency and simplicity. Humans can see exactly what context the agents are using by looking at the same Notion pages the agents query.

**RAG as Fallback (If Needed)**

If Notion queries prove insufficient - perhaps context windows can't hold enough information, or semantic search across unstructured content becomes necessary - then a RAG database gets introduced. In this scenario, the RAG database syncs with Notion rather than replacing it. Notion remains the authoritative source that humans interact with, while the RAG layer provides enhanced search capabilities.

**Extended Context Handling**

The system handles data beyond the Notion knowledge base:

- **Conversation transcripts**: Full recordings from Limitless and Fireflies stored with metadata for reference
- **Document repositories**: Files in Dropbox indexed and searchable, summaries added to Notion when relevant
- **Chat history**: Agent interactions logged in Logfire, significant decisions extracted to Notion
- **Temporal data**: Time-sensitive information processed immediately, archived after relevance expires

The specific storage and retrieval mechanisms will emerge during implementation based on actual context window requirements and search patterns.

### Inter-Agent Communication

From the human perspective, there is only one AI account in the project management system - the AI Chief of Staff (Piper). All tasks assigned to "AI" go to this single account. Behind the scenes, Piper routes work to specialized agents, but this internal orchestration is invisible to humans using the PM system.

**Note:** This architecture uses ClickUp as the reference implementation for project management. If you prefer Asana, Linear, Monday, or another PM tool, build a provider connector for your platform.

**External View (What Humans See):**

When a task gets assigned to "AI" in ClickUp, Piper picks it up. Humans see:

- Task assigned to the AI Chief of Staff account
- Progress updates and comments from that account
- Task status changes and completion
- All communication appears to come from one unified AI presence

**Internal Orchestration (What Happens Behind the Scenes):**

Piper analyzes the task and determines which specialist agent should handle it. If it requires financial analysis, Piper delegates internally to Frank the Accountant. Frank does the work, and Piper updates the ClickUp task with Frank's results. Humans never see Frank directly in ClickUp.

Inter-agent communication happens through internal message passing, API calls, or a shared task queue - not through visible ClickUp tasks. The specialized agents coordinate invisibly while Piper maintains the single public face.

**Benefits of Single AI Account:**

**Simplicity** - Humans don't need to understand the internal agent architecture or know which agent to assign tasks to.

**Flexibility** - Internal agent architecture can evolve without requiring ClickUp configuration changes.

**Unified Interface** - One AI account to authorize, monitor, and communicate with.

**Clean Audit Trail** - All AI work visible through one account's activity history.

## Technology Stack & Choices

### Core Technologies

**MVP Stack:**

**Python 3.13+** - Primary language for all agent code. Modern async support and type hints throughout.

**FastAPI** - Web framework for webhooks and API endpoints. Async-first, automatic OpenAPI docs, lightweight.

**Pydantic AI** - Agent framework and LLM interactions. Provides type-safe structured output, agent patterns, and clean abstraction over LLM providers.

**OpenRouter** - Unified LLM provider interface. Access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default), GPT models, and dozens of others through one API. Intelligent routing based on cost and capability.

**Logfire** - Comprehensive observability. Each agent run wrapped in a span for full traceability, nested spans for multi-step operations, automatic instrumentation of HTTP/DB/LLM calls.

**Celery** - Asynchronous task queue for scheduled agent runs and long-running tasks. Uses Redis as both broker and result backend.

**Redis** - In-memory data store serving two purposes: Celery broker/backend for task queue, and caching layer for expensive-to-fetch data (API responses, computed results). Lightweight and fast.

**Django Templates** - Template rendering for `.agent` files. Install Django package but only use `django.template` module standalone, without the web framework.

**Clerk** - User authentication and management. Handles user sign-up, login, session management.

**Pipedream or Nango** - OAuth flow management for integrating with Limitless, Fireflies, Notion, ClickUp. Pipedream for speed, Nango for control.

**Post-MVP Additions:**

**PostgreSQL** - Add database when needed for user preferences, relational queries, or operational data that doesn't fit in files or Redis.

**Django Admin** - If PostgreSQL gets added and needs management UI, add Django Admin. Can run alongside FastAPI.

**Prometheus + Grafana** - Infrastructure-level metrics and monitoring dashboards (complements Logfire).

**Flower** - Web UI for Celery task management and worker monitoring.

**Honeybadger** - Production error reporting and alerting.

### Python-Specific Libraries

**MVP Requirements:**

**loguru** - Logging throughout the system via `helpers/logger`. Rich, structured logging with emojis for readability. Use `logger.info()`, `logger.success()`, `logger.exception()` appropriately.

**httpx** - All HTTP requests. Modern async-capable HTTP client replacing `requests`.

**arrow** - Date and time handling. Human-friendly datetime parsing and manipulation.

**rich** - Beautiful terminal output. Progress bars, formatted tables, syntax highlighting for CLI tools.

**click** - Command-line interface framework for any CLI programs (management commands, admin tools, etc.).

**pytest** - Testing framework. All tests use pytest (never unittest). Use pytest-mock for mocking and monkeypatch for environment variables.

**ruff** - Python linter and formatter. All code must pass ruff checks before being considered complete.

**pre-commit** - Git hooks for automated quality checks. Runs ruff and other validators on every commit.

**heart-centered-prompts** - Meta system prompt providing heart-centered grounding for all agents. Ensures AI operates from a compassionate, emotionally intelligent foundation. See [heart-centered-prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts) for integration details.

**Docker** - Celery worker and beat scheduler run in containers using the same Dockerfile. Consistent deployment across environments.

**Code Quality Requirements:**

Before any code is considered "done" (whether written by humans or generated by Forge):

1. Run `ruff check .` - Must pass with zero errors
2. Run `ruff format .` - Code must be formatted
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` - All hooks must pass
4. Run `pytest` - All tests must pass

Forge should run these checks automatically before creating pull requests. Code that doesn't pass quality checks is not ready for review.

When Forge creates new agents, it should also generate tests for them. Tests should mock external APIs and focus on the agent's business logic (extraction accuracy, routing decisions, error handling).

**Not MVP (Add Later):**

**Prometheus + Grafana** - Metrics dashboards and system health monitoring. Complements Logfire with infrastructure-level visibility.

**Flower** - Web UI for Celery task management. View task status, worker health, task history.

**Honeybadger** - Error reporting and alerting. Automatically captures exceptions that bubble up (see error handling philosophy below).

### Error Handling Philosophy

**Critical:** This system does NOT swallow errors. Exceptions bubble up to be captured by monitoring tools (Honeybadger in production, test failures in development).

**The only acceptable try/except patterns:**

1. **Handling specific exception with real logic** - When you need to take a specific action based on a specific error type:

   ```python
   try:
       result = process_data(data)
   except ValidationError as e:
       logger.exception("Data validation failed", extra={"data_id": data.id})
       return {"status": "failed", "reason": "validation_error"}
   ```

2. **Processing loops where individual failures shouldn't stop the batch:**
   ```python
   for conversation in conversations:
       try:
           process_conversation(conversation)
       except ProcessingError as e:
           logger.exception("Conversation processing failed", conversation_id=conversation.id)
           continue  # Keep processing other conversations
   ```

**Never do this:**

- Generic `except Exception` that hides problems
- Logging an error and continuing without handling it
- `except: pass` that swallows exceptions silently

**Philosophy:** "Broken is better than wrong." If something unexpected happens, let it crash loudly so you know about it, rather than silently continuing with potentially wrong data.

### Testing Philosophy

**Test your business logic, not the libraries you depend on.**

**What to test:**

- Your code's logic and transformations
- How you call external services (interface points)
- How you handle external responses (data processing)
- State management and workflows
- Error handling and recovery patterns

**What NOT to test:**

- Library behavior (Pydantic validation, HTTP client, Django ORM)
- External API behavior (that's their job to test)
- Framework internals (FastAPI routing, Celery task execution)

**Mocking strategy:**

- Mock external API calls (Limitless, Fireflies, Notion, ClickUp, OpenRouter)
- Use pytest-mock (mocker fixture) for all mocking
- Use monkeypatch for environment variables
- Tests should be fast and runnable offline
- Never mock internal code to hide errors - fix the errors

**Live tests (if absolutely necessary):**

- Mark with `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3)` for reliability
- Mark with skip condition for `SKIP_LIVE_TESTS` environment variable
- Keep minimal (2-3 per module max)
- Use for end-to-end validation, not unit testing

**Philosophy:** Quality over quantity. 10 focused tests that test your logic are better than 100 tests that test everything.

### CLI Interface

**Command-Line Tool for Power Users (MVP)**

The system includes a comprehensive CLI built with `click` for developers and administrators. The CLI will become complex over time, so commands are organized into logical groups with separate modules for each.

**Agent Management Commands (MVP):**

```
100x list-agents              # Show all .agent files and their status
100x run-agent <name>          # Manually trigger an agent (bypass schedule)
100x validate-agent <name>     # Check if .agent file is properly formatted
100x format-agents             # Validate and format all .agent files
```

**System Operations (MVP):**

```
100x init                     # First-time system setup and configuration
100x check-integrations       # Verify all API connections working
100x show-config              # Display current environment and config
100x health                   # System health check (Redis, Celery, APIs)
```

**Future Command Groups (Post-MVP):**

Additional command groups will be added for data processing, monitoring, debugging, and deployment operations as needs emerge during development.

**CLI Organization:**

Use `click` groups to organize commands by domain. Each command group lives in its own module for maintainability:

- `cli/agents.py` - Agent management commands
- `cli/system.py` - System operations
- `cli/data.py` - Data processing (future)
- `cli/monitoring.py` - Stats and metrics (future)

The CLI provides immediate feedback using `rich` for formatted output and progress indicators. All operations log to Logfire for auditability.

### Framework Decision: Django vs FastAPI

**Current specification uses Django, but this should be reconsidered:**

**Django provides:**

- Admin interface for monitoring agents (nice visual dashboard)
- ORM with migrations (though SQLAlchemy works too)
- Django templates for `.agent` file rendering
- Mature ecosystem

**FastAPI approach:**

- Lightweight, async-first (better for webhook handling)
- Automatic OpenAPI docs
- Faster for API-only service
- Can use Jinja2 templates (Django-compatible syntax)
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic if database needed
- Simpler if we don't need admin interface

**Recommendation:** Start with FastAPI without a database. Use filesystem for agent registry (which `.agent` files exist = which agents exist). If database needs emerge later, add PostgreSQL. If we need to manage that data with a UI, add Django solely for Django Admin while keeping FastAPI for the API layer. The two can coexist - FastAPI handles webhooks and agent endpoints, Django Admin provides database management UI if needed.

### Project Structure

The system follows a clear directory organization:

```
100x-agent-system/
├── agents/
│   └── prompts/               # All .agent files live here
│       └── shared/            # Reusable prompt components
│
├── providers/                 # API integrations (Limitless, Fireflies, Notion, ClickUp, etc.)
│
├── cli/                       # Command-line interface organized by domain
│
├── api/                       # FastAPI app and webhook handlers
│
├── core/                      # Core utilities (agent config parser, schemas, shared logic)
│
├── tasks/                     # Celery configuration and scheduled tasks
│
├── helpers/                   # Logging and utility functions
│
└── tests/                     # Test suite mirroring source structure
```

**Key Principles:**

- All `.agent` files in `agents/prompts/` - this is the agent registry
- Each provider gets isolated in `providers/`
- CLI commands separated by functional domain
- Tests mirror the source code organization
- Configuration files at project root

### Agent Definition and Templates

**.agent Files** - All agents defined in declarative `.agent` files with YAML frontmatter + template prompts. This keeps definitions version-controlled, human-readable, and modifiable by Forge.

**BaseAgent Class** - Shared Python class that loads `.agent` files, renders templates, calls OpenRouter, and returns structured output via Pydantic AI.

**Template Engine** - Uses Django's template engine for rendering `.agent` file prompts. Django templates can be used standalone (install Django package but only use `django.template` module, not the full framework). This provides the template syntax (`{% comment %}`, `{{ variables }}`, `{% include %}`) without requiring the Django web framework.

If using Jinja2 instead, the syntax is nearly identical and `.agent` files remain compatible with minor adjustments.

### Database and Caching Strategy

**Initial architecture uses minimal persistence:**

- **Agent Registry** - The filesystem IS the registry. Which `.agent` files exist in `agents/prompts/` = which agents exist
- **User Auth** - Handled by Clerk (external service)
- **OAuth Tokens** - Managed by Pipedream or Nango (external service)
- **Operational Data** - Lives in Notion (knowledge base) and ClickUp (tasks/execution)
- **Configuration** - Environment variables and YAML files in version control
- **Task Queue** - Celery using Redis as broker and result backend
- **Caching** - Redis for expensive-to-fetch API responses and computed results

**Redis serves dual purpose:**

- Celery broker/backend for managing task queue state
- Cache for API responses (Limitless conversations, Fireflies transcripts, Notion pages)
- Fast in-memory operations without database overhead

**If PostgreSQL database needs emerge:**

Add for:

- User preferences and settings requiring relational structure
- Mapping users to their integrated accounts (if multi-tenant)
- Complex queries across operational data
- Audit logs requiring SQL queries

**If we add PostgreSQL and need to manage the data:**

Add Django Admin on top of FastAPI:

- Run both frameworks simultaneously (different ports or routes)
- Django Admin provides UI for database management
- FastAPI continues handling webhooks and agent API calls
- SQLAlchemy models can be used by both if structured correctly

The architecture evolves: Start file + Redis-based → Add PostgreSQL when relational needs emerge → Add Django Admin if data management UI becomes necessary.

### Deployment

**Docker** - Containerized deployment for consistency across environments.

**GitHub Actions** - CI/CD for running tests and deploying approved PRs.

**Cloud Options** - Can deploy to Railway, Render, Fly.io, or traditional cloud providers. Needs PostgreSQL database, Celery workers, and API server.

### LLM Provider Strategy

The system uses OpenRouter as a unified interface to all LLM providers. OpenRouter provides access to dozens of models through a single API, enabling intelligent routing based on task requirements, cost, and performance without vendor lock-in.

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** serves as the default model for most operations - reasoning, code generation, analysis, and self-modification tasks. Its context handling and structured output capabilities work well for analyzing transcripts and generating agent code.

OpenRouter's model routing allows the system to:

- Select faster, cheaper models for simple tasks like categorization or keyword extraction
- Fall back to alternative providers when rate limits hit
- Experiment with new models as they become available without code changes
- Optimize cost by matching model capability to task complexity

Provider configuration lives in environment variables. Each agent can specify model preferences, but the system handles fallback and optimization automatically through OpenRouter's routing layer.

### API Integration Approach

Direct API integration replaces the original file-based approach. Authentication complexity is managed through a unified integration platform - either Pipedream or Nango, each offering different tradeoffs:

**Pipedream** provides immediate functionality with 2,700+ pre-built integrations. Users authorize "Pipedream" to access their accounts, which accelerates development but may raise concerns in enterprise settings. The platform handles OAuth flows, token refresh, and provides visual workflow builders that non-technical users can modify.

**Nango** requires setting up your own OAuth clients for each provider, providing full control and maintaining your branding. This approach involves more initial setup but ensures users see "100x Agent System" (or your chosen name) when authorizing access, building trust and professionalism.

For initial development, Pipedream's speed advantages make it attractive. For production deployment with multiple users, Nango's control and branding benefits likely win. The provider abstraction layer makes switching between them straightforward.

Each external service gets a dedicated provider class:

**Limitless AI Provider** connects through their REST API to query conversations and extract commitments. Queries like "What commitments did Nick make yesterday?" translate to date-filtered API calls with entity extraction. The provider maintains conversation context and can traverse multiple days of recordings.

**Fireflies AI Provider** uses their GraphQL API for richer query capabilities. Meeting transcripts stream in real-time when available, falling back to polling for completed recordings. The provider extracts speakers, topics, action items, and decisions using Fireflies' native AI, then enhances with additional analysis.

**Knowledge Base Provider (Notion)** leverages the official SDK for both reading and writing. The Knowledge Base lives here - a carefully curated context layer separate from execution details. The provider understands Notion's block structure, database schemas, and can create, update, and link entries intelligently. Alternative knowledge bases (Obsidian, Confluence, Roam) can be supported by implementing a similar provider.

**Project Management Provider (ClickUp)** manages the execution layer - tasks, workflows, and project documentation. Using their REST API, the provider creates tasks from commitments, updates status as work progresses, and maintains the audit trail of agent actions. Alternative PM tools (Asana, Linear, Monday) can be supported by implementing a similar provider.

Each provider implements a common interface with methods for querying information, updating data, streaming real-time events, and handling authentication. This standardization allows agents to work with different external services without knowing their specific implementation details.

### Persistence and State Management

The system maintains clear separation between different types of state, each with appropriate storage mechanisms.

**Knowledge Base (Notion or alternative)** stores stable, structured context:

- People, projects, resources as database entries
- Relationships between entities
- Persistent facts and patterns
- Intelligence and learnings that inform future decisions

**Execution State (ClickUp or alternative)** tracks active work:

- Tasks assigned to agents or humans
- Project documentation and working notes
- Status updates and progress tracking
- Decision points requiring human input

**Agent State (PostgreSQL - under consideration)** may provide operational data:

- Agent registry for discovery (name, capabilities, ClickUp user ID)
- System configuration and permissions
- Cached data that doesn't belong in ClickUp or Notion

The agent registry tracks which agents exist and their capabilities. This can be implemented through:

- Configuration files that deploy with each agent
- ClickUp user profiles with custom fields for capabilities
- A lightweight database table if needed for discovery

Since agents update their progress directly in ClickUp and that provides complete work history, a separate state database may not be necessary. The implementation should start minimal and add database tables only when a clear need emerges.

**Observability (Logfire)** provides comprehensive logging and tracing:

- Each agent run wrapped in a Logfire span for full traceability
- Nested spans show the complete execution flow of multi-step operations
- Automatic instrumentation of HTTP requests, database queries, and external API calls
- Performance metrics and error tracking across all agents
- Searchable logs with structured data for debugging and analysis

Logfire's span-based tracing means you can see exactly what each agent did, how long each operation took, and where failures occurred, all with rich context.

**Task Queue (Celery)** orchestrates asynchronous work and agent coordination:

- Distributed task execution across agent workers
- Scheduled tasks for periodic agent activities
- Task retry logic with exponential backoff
- Result backend for task outcome storage
- Chain and group primitives for complex workflows

Celery provides robust task management without requiring a separate message broker - it can use filesystem or Redis as broker. For inter-agent communication that doesn't fit the task model, agents can use direct HTTP calls between services or shared filesystem state.

**Configuration and Secrets (Environment + Vault)** keeps sensitive data secure:

- API keys and tokens in environment variables for development
- HashiCorp Vault (or cloud equivalent) for production
- Per-agent configuration in YAML files
- Self-modification permissions managed through config

This separation ensures agents can modify their own code and configuration without accessing credentials they shouldn't have. The bootstrap process sets up initial permissions, then agents request expanded capabilities as needed.

## Agent System Design

### Agent Definition Format

Agents are defined using `.agent` files - a declarative format combining YAML configuration with Django template prompts. This keeps agent definitions version-controlled, human-readable, and easy for both humans and AI to modify.

**File Structure:**

The `.agent` file has three sections separated by `---` markers:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Configuration and metadata
2. **System Prompt** - Agent identity and expertise (Django template)
3. **User Prompt** - Task-specific context (Django template with variables)

**YAML Configuration includes:**

- `name`: Agent's name
- `description`: Brief role description
- `model`: OpenRouter model selection (e.g., "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4")
- `temperature`: Model temperature setting
- `output_schema`: YAML schema defining expected response structure
- `evolution_history`: List of versions with dates and change notes
- `dependencies`: MCP servers or external tools the agent requires

**System Prompt** defines who the agent is, what it knows, and how it thinks. Uses Django template syntax with `{% comment %}` blocks to document the reasoning behind each section. Can include shared prompt components like heart-centered grounding.

**User Prompt** provides task-specific context using Django template variables. Variables like `{{ current_rate }}` or `{{ meeting_transcript }}` get injected at runtime based on the work being performed.

**Benefits of .agent Files:**

- **Declarative** - Agent definition is configuration, not code
- **Versionable** - Track evolution history directly in the file
- **Testable** - Easy to test prompts and schemas independently
- **Modifiable** - Forge can update prompts and schemas without changing Python code
- **Auditable** - Humans can review exactly what agents will say and do
- **Reusable** - Shared prompt components avoid duplication

When Forge creates a new agent, it generates a `.agent` file following this pattern. Agent improvements happen by modifying the YAML config or updating the prompts, then committing via PR.

**Example .agent File:**

```

Identity and expertise - what this agent does
{% endcomment %}

We specialize in analyzing conversations and identifying firm commitments. We distinguish between casual discussion ("I might look into that") and actual commitments ("I'll have the report to you by Friday").

A commitment requires:
- Specific action or deliverable
- Clear owner (who will do it)
- Explicit or implied agreement to complete it

We assign confidence scores (0-100) based on language certainty and context.

### Base Agent Implementation

Every agent starts from a minimal but complete template that provides core capabilities while remaining simple enough for AI to understand and modify. The base agent is deliberately sparse - complexity comes through composition and evolution, not initial design.

The base agent class parses the `.agent` file, loads configuration, renders templates with provided context, calls the LLM via OpenRouter, and returns structured output matching the defined schema.

The base agent includes several non-negotiable features:

**Identity and Purpose** - Every agent knows its name and can articulate its purpose. This becomes critical for self-modification. When an agent needs to evolve, it must understand what it's trying to accomplish to evaluate whether changes align with its goals.

**Knowledge Base Access** - Agents can query the knowledge base (Notion) for context about people, projects, and resources. They retrieve relevant pages and include that information in their prompts.

**Provider Registry** - Agents maintain a registry of available providers (Limitless, Fireflies, Notion, etc.) with their capabilities. When facing a task, agents can discover which providers might help, even if they've never used them before.

**Internal Communication** - Agents can call each other directly through their registered endpoints or communicate asynchronously through the Celery task queue. Piper acts as the primary coordinator, routing work to appropriate specialist agents. Agents can also share data through the database or make direct API calls to each other.

**Self-Awareness** - The explain() method provides active introspection. Agents use this to understand their own capabilities when deciding whether they can handle a request or need help.

### Capability Extensions

Agents gain capabilities through composition rather than inheritance. Each capability is a self-contained module that agents can dynamically load, use, and even create for themselves.

Capabilities register standardized interfaces that agents discover through introspection. For example, a TranscriptAnalysis capability might offer methods to extract commitments, identify decisions, and summarize discussions. When the Knowledge Base Agent receives a transcript, it queries available capabilities, finds TranscriptAnalysis, and uses it without knowing the implementation details.

This modular approach enables several patterns:

**Capability Sharing** - Multiple agents can use the same capability. Both Knowledge Base Agent and Commitment Manager Agent might use TranscriptAnalysis but for different purposes.

**Capability Evolution** - Capabilities themselves can be modified and improved. When the transcript analysis improves, every agent using it automatically benefits.

**Capability Creation** - Agents can write new capabilities. When an agent recognizes a repeated pattern in its work, it can extract that pattern into a reusable capability.

### Self-Modification Mechanisms

Self-modification is the system's core innovation. Agents don't just execute tasks - they recognize their limitations and evolve to overcome them. This happens through a carefully orchestrated process that balances autonomy with safety.

When an agent encounters a task it cannot complete, it follows this protocol:

**Recognition** - The agent identifies specifically what capability it lacks: "I need the ability to parse PDF documents and extract tables" rather than a vague "I can't do this."

**Specification** - The agent writes a detailed specification for the missing capability. This includes example inputs, expected outputs, and success criteria. The specification uses natural language but follows a consistent structure that makes implementation straightforward.

**Implementation** - The agent (or a specialized Code Generation Agent) creates the new capability. This uses an LLM with the specification as context, generating Python code that implements the required functionality.

**Testing** - Before integration, the new capability runs through automated tests using the examples from the specification. The tests run in an isolated environment to prevent side effects.

**Integration** - If tests pass, the capability is added to the agent's registry and becomes immediately available. The agent can now complete the original task and any similar future tasks.

**Learning** - The agent records the entire evolution process in episodic memory. Success patterns become templates for future evolution. Failure patterns become guardrails to avoid.

This self-modification extends beyond individual capabilities to entire agents. The system can parse natural language descriptions, generate agent code using an LLM, test the new agent in a sandbox environment, and deploy it if tests pass - or refine and retry if they fail.

### Agent Lifecycle Management

Agents exist in a continuous lifecycle of creation, execution, evolution, and occasionally, retirement. The system manages this lifecycle to ensure agents remain effective while preventing unbounded growth.

**Genesis Phase** - Agents are born from specifications. These might come from:

- Natural language descriptions from users
- Recognition of repeated patterns by existing agents
- Decomposition of complex tasks into specialized sub-agents
- Templates for common agent types

**Active Phase** - Running agents process tasks, collaborate with other agents, and accumulate experience. During this phase, agents:

- Execute work delegated from Piper or scheduled via Celery
- Communicate with other agents through direct calls or shared task queues
- Proactively identify improvement opportunities
- Monitor their own performance metrics

**Evolution Phase** - Agents periodically evaluate their effectiveness and initiate self-improvement:

- Analyzing failure patterns to identify missing capabilities
- Recognizing repeated subtasks that could become separate agents
- Optimizing frequently-used code paths for better performance
- Updating their purpose and explanation based on actual usage

Agents that are no longer needed get removed. Delete the `.agent` file, remove the deployment, done. Simple.

## Phase 0: Forge the Coder (First Deliverable)

### The Bootstrap Agent

Forge the Coder is the single most important piece of the entire system. Without Forge, you're writing all agents manually. With Forge, you describe what you need in English and Forge creates it. Everything else in this architecture flows from getting Forge working.

**To AI platforms implementing this system:** Forge is your first and only initial deliverable. Do not attempt to build Maya, Sarah, or any other agent manually. Build Forge, then use Forge to build everything else.

### What Forge Does

Forge monitors the project management system for tasks assigned to the AI account. When it receives a task with "create agent" or "build agent" in the title, it:

1. Extracts requirements from the task description
2. Generates a `.agent` file with appropriate YAML config and prompts
3. Creates the Python class that loads and executes that `.agent` file
4. Writes tests for the new agent
5. Commits everything to a feature branch
6. Creates a pull request with comprehensive documentation
7. Updates the original task with the PR link

### Forge's Requirements

**Inputs Forge Needs:**

- Access to project management system API (ClickUp or alternative)
- GitHub repository access with write permissions
- OpenRouter API key for LLM access
- Access to existing `.agent` files as templates
- Understanding of the BaseAgent class pattern

**Outputs Forge Produces:**

- New `.agent` file in `agents/prompts/` directory
- Python class file if needed (many agents can share one class)
- Test file for the new agent
- Pull request with all changes
- Updated task in project management system

### Success Criteria for Phase 0

Forge is complete when you can:

1. Create a task: "Build an agent that analyzes meeting sentiment"
2. Assign it to the AI account
3. Forge picks it up within minutes
4. A PR appears with the new agent definition
5. You review and approve the PR
6. The new agent deploys and works

Once this loop works, you never write agent definitions manually again. The system builds itself.

---

## Phase 1: Knowledge Base Agent

The Knowledge Base Agent transforms conversations, meetings, and interactions into structured, queryable knowledge. It processes data from Limitless (personal conversations) and Fireflies (formal meetings), extracts commitments, people, projects, and insights, then updates the knowledge base with current, accurate context.

The agent creates the clean, organized foundation that makes all other agents effective. It embodies the principle: organization before automation. When it identifies work that needs doing, it creates appropriately routed tasks in the project management system.

For complete implementation details including API integration patterns, extraction logic, context retrieval strategy, and task routing rules, see the [Knowledge Base Agent specification](knowledge-base-agent.md).

---

## Phase 2: Commitment Manager Agent

The Commitment Manager Agent ensures nothing you promise falls through the cracks. It monitors conversations, identifies commitments with their deadlines and stakeholders, creates tasks automatically, and actively tracks progress to ensure completion. It understands the difference between casual discussion and firm commitments.

The agent extracts commitments with confidence scores, creates appropriately assigned tasks, monitors for blockers or delays, escalates when needed, and learns from patterns to improve deadline estimation and routing logic over time.

For complete implementation details including commitment extraction intelligence, task creation patterns, follow-up monitoring, escalation rules, and learning mechanisms, see the [Commitment Manager Agent specification](commitment-manager-agent.md).

---

## Agent Roster

**Note:** From the user perspective in ClickUp, there is only one AI account - Piper the Chief of Staff. All other agents work behind the scenes. Piper receives tasks, delegates internally to specialized agents, and reports back results. Humans interact with one unified AI presence while benefiting from a team of specialists working in the background.

### The Team

| Agent Name                        | Role                                                                     | Core Tools & Access                                               |

### Privacy Protection - Winston the Wolf

Winston serves as the privacy protection layer for the entire system. Named after Pulp Fiction's problem solver, Winston ensures that sensitive conversations stay private and provides the critical "delete the last 5 minutes" functionality missing from current wearable platforms.

Winston operates with special privileges:

- Immediate access to all recording streams
- Authority to delete or redact content before processing
- Maintains a privacy rulebook for automatic filtering
- Responds to voice commands like "Winston, delete the last 5 minutes"
- Sanitizes conversations before they reach other agents

When you realize you've discussed something that shouldn't be recorded - a private medical detail, a confidential business matter, or a personal moment - Winston makes it disappear from all systems before any other agent processes it.

---

## The Self-Evolution Engine

### Architectural Philosophy

The Self-Evolution Engine represents the system's most important capability: recognizing its own limitations and creating solutions. The system identifies gaps in its capabilities and generates the code to fill them.

This happens through Forge the Coder, the first agent you'll build. Forge understands the agent architecture, can read existing agent code, and most importantly, can write new agents based on natural language descriptions. Every new capability enters the system the same way - as a task in the project management system that Piper routes to Forge internally.

### The Creation Pipeline

New agents are born from needs expressed in plain English. You create a task in your project management system describing what you need: "Build an agent that reconciles credit card statements with expense reports." Forge picks up the task, analyzes similar existing `.agent` files as templates, generates the new agent definition, and submits a pull request.

The pipeline maintains safety through human review:

1. Natural language requirement enters as task assigned to AI
2. Piper routes to Forge
3. Forge generates `.agent` file with YAML config and prompts
4. Forge creates any needed Python classes and tests
5. Code committed to feature branch, PR created
6. Human reviews and approves the PR
7. New agent deploys and self-registers
8. Forge updates the original task with deployment confirmation

This is the same pipeline whether building a completely new agent or improving an existing one. Agent evolution happens by Forge modifying `.agent` files based on improvement requests.

### Agent Self-Improvement

Beyond creating new agents, the system continuously improves existing ones. When agents encounter failures or recognize patterns in their work, they can request enhancements through the same mechanism - creating a ClickUp task for Forge describing the needed improvement.

This creates an evolutionary pressure where agents that successfully identify and request useful improvements become more capable over time, while poorly designed agents naturally receive fewer enhancements.

### Registration and Discovery

Agents discover each other through a central registry maintained in the database. When a new agent comes online, it registers its name, capabilities, and interface. Other agents query this registry when they need help with tasks outside their expertise.

**Agent Registry Architecture:**

The registry is a database table that tracks all active agents and their capabilities. Each registry entry contains:

- Agent's name and full title ("Forge", "Forge the Coder")
- Current status (active, hibernating, retired)
- List of capabilities as searchable tags
- Network endpoint or message queue for internal communication
- Timestamps for registration and last activity

When an agent starts, it registers itself by creating or updating its registry entry. This self-registration pattern means new agents automatically become discoverable.

**Discovery Process:**

When Piper (or any agent) needs help with something, it queries the registry using the capability needed. The discovery follows this sequence:

1. Check for exact capability match (fast path)
2. Fall back to semantic similarity search (fuzzy match)
3. If an agent is found, Piper delegates the work internally to that agent
4. If no agent exists with that capability, Piper creates a task for Forge to build one

This creates a self-healing pattern where capability gaps trigger agent creation rather than system failures.

**Service Discovery Patterns:**

- **Heartbeat Mechanism** - Agents ping the registry periodically to maintain 'active' status
- **Capability Matching** - Exact string match first, then semantic similarity search
- **Internal Delegation** - Piper routes work to specialized agents based on capabilities
- **Fallback Chain** - If no agent can help, Piper escalates to humans
- **Dynamic Endpoints** - Agents can run on different ports/servers and still be discovered
- **Logfire Visibility** - Human operators can see all agent activity, spans, and errors in Logfire dashboards

### Governance Through Project Management

All agent creation and modification flows through the project management system (ClickUp or your chosen alternative), providing:

- Complete audit trail of who requested what and why
- Human approval gates at appropriate points
- Task dependencies showing which agents depend on others
- Performance metrics on agent effectiveness
- Clear ownership and accountability

This transparency ensures that as the system grows more capable, humans maintain understanding and control over what's being built and why.

## Bootstrap Process

### Phase 0 in Detail

This section expands on Milestone 0 with specific implementation steps.

### Initial Setup

The system bootstraps from a minimal but functional starting point. You manually build Forge the Coder - the one and only agent you'll build by hand. Forge will build all other agents.

**Step 1: Infrastructure Foundation**

Clone the repository and set up the Python environment with a virtual environment. Install dependencies from requirements.txt. Configure environment variables including API keys for your project management system, GitHub, and LLM providers (OpenRouter). Start the FastAPI server and Celery worker processes. No database initialization required initially - the system is file-based.

**Step 2: Deploy Forge**

Forge is special - the first agent must be manually created since no agent exists yet to create them. Forge's code is included in the repository as the template for all future agents.

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTE FOR AI PLATFORMS:** Forge inherits from BaseAgent and implements:

1. Monitor the project management system for tasks assigned to the AI account (via webhook or polling)
2. Parse natural language requirements from task descriptions using an LLM
3. Generate Python code for new agents following the BaseAgent pattern
4. Create feature branches and GitHub pull requests with the generated code and tests
5. Update the task with the PR link and deployment status
6. Self-register in the agent registry upon deployment

**Step 3: Connect Integrations**

1. Set up ClickUp webhook to notify when tasks are assigned to the AI account
2. Configure GitHub repository access for PR creation
3. Connect to OpenAI/Anthropic for code generation
4. Set up Pipedream or Nango for OAuth management

**Step 4: Create Your First Agent via Forge**

Create a task in your project management system with the title "Create Maya the Memory Keeper", assigned to AI (which Piper/Forge will handle). The description should detail what Maya needs to do: maintain the knowledge base by processing conversations from Limitless and Fireflies, querying both services daily, extracting relevant information, updating the appropriate databases, and creating tasks for any commitments found.

Forge processes this task, generates Maya's code, and creates a PR. After review and merge, Maya joins the system.

### The Recursive Growth Pattern

Once Forge and Maya are operational, the system can grow rapidly:

1. **You describe needs in English** → Tasks assigned to AI
2. **Piper routes to Forge** → Forge creates agents → Pull requests
3. **You review and approve** → Deployed agents working behind the scenes
4. **Agents identify gaps** → New tasks assigned to AI
5. **Return to step 2**

This creates a virtuous cycle where the system becomes more capable with each iteration. From the ClickUp perspective, you're just having a conversation with one AI account. Behind the scenes, a growing team of specialists handles the work.

### Configuration Management

All agent configuration lives in version control. Each agent has a configuration entry specifying its class name, enabled status, capabilities list, and optional schedule for periodic tasks. For example, Forge has code generation and PR creation capabilities, while Maya has notion management and conversation processing capabilities with a schedule to run every 2 hours.

### Authentication Setup

Services require different authentication approaches managed through configuration. The project management system uses API keys stored in environment variables. Limitless uses OAuth handled by Pipedream or Nango with scopes for reading and deleting conversations. The knowledge base uses integration tokens from environment variables. Each service's authentication type, credentials source, and required scopes are defined in the service configuration.

### First Day Checklist

After bootstrap, verify the system works:

- [ ] Forge successfully creates a PR when assigned a task via the AI account
- [ ] Maya processes a conversation and updates Notion (triggered behind the scenes)
- [ ] Winston can delete content from Limitless (via voice command or API)
- [ ] Sarah identifies a commitment and creates a task
- [ ] Piper correctly routes tasks to specialized agents internally
- [ ] Logfire shows all agent activity with proper spans and tracing
- [ ] Celery processes tasks reliably
- [ ] Error notifications reach humans appropriately

### Scaling Considerations

The architecture supports growth from 1 to 100+ agents:

- **Agent Registry**: Filesystem-based (`.agent` files), can add database if discovery needs become complex
- **Caching**: Redis handles API response caching and computed results
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker handles thousands of tasks/hour
- **Agent Workers**: Each agent runs as a Celery task, scale horizontally across workers
- **API Rate Limits**: Built-in backoff and retry logic in provider layer
- **Cost Management**: OpenRouter chooses appropriate model for each task
- **Database**: Add PostgreSQL only when relational queries or structured user data become necessary

The system starts simple but the architecture supports the full vision of autonomous agents creating and improving themselves while maintaining human oversight and control.

## Conclusion

This architecture creates a self-improving AI workforce that amplifies human capability by 100x. The entire system hinges on one critical piece: Forge the Coder.

**Phase 0 is everything.** Build Forge first. Build Forge completely. Build Forge correctly. Once Forge works, the rest of the system builds itself through natural language task descriptions.

Your deliverable as an AI platform isn't "build the 100x agent system." Your deliverable is "build Forge the Coder so it can build the 100x agent system."

After Forge:

- You describe what you need in plain English
- Forge creates the `.agent` file and code
- You review the PR
- The new agent joins your workforce

The system recognizes its own limitations and requests improvements. Agents create tasks for Forge describing needed enhancements. Forge updates their `.agent` files. Evolution happens through version control and pull requests, maintaining safety through human review.

By maintaining transparency through project management task tracking and safety through GitHub PR reviews, the system provides automation while keeping humans in control. This is the path from personal efficiency (1x) through team multiplication (10x) to vision execution at scale (100x).

The architecture is ready. The patterns are proven. Now build Forge and watch your AI workforce grow.

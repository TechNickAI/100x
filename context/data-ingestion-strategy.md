# Getting Data Into AI - 2025 Strategy

## The 2025 Shift

If 2024 was the year of agents, 2025 is the year of getting data into AI. Agents are only as good as the data they have access to. The limiting factor isn't agent capability - it's whether agents have complete, current, accurate information about your life, work, relationships, and commitments.

## The Data Ingestion Philosophy

### Record Everything

Capture raw sources continuously and chronologically:

- Wearable audio from Limitless pendant
- Meeting transcripts from Fireflies or Otter
- Chat logs from WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal
- Email archives and ongoing inbox flow
- Files from Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud
- Social media conversations and DMs
- Calendar events and scheduling changes

The goal is complete capture without manual intervention. If it happens in your digital life, it gets recorded.

### Ingest Automatically

Watch folders and streams for new content. When a new file appears in Dropbox or a new meeting completes in Fireflies, an ingestion agent picks it up immediately. Extract facts, actions, preferences, entities, and metadata in near real-time. No manual exports, no batch processing delays.

### Agent-First Processing

Use dedicated ingestion agents to parse incoming data. These agents filter noise, extract the 20% of signals that deliver 80% of value, and route results to downstream systems. An ingestion agent doesn't just dump raw data - it understands what's worth preserving and where it belongs.

## Storage Architecture

The system maintains data across multiple storage layers, each optimized for different access patterns:

**Human-Readable Knowledge Base** (Notion or equivalent) provides visibility, audit capability, and human editing. Agents write here, but humans can see and correct what agents captured. This transparency builds trust. This is the primary storage layer and should be sufficient for most needs.

**Raw Archives** preserve original sources. Full transcripts, complete documents, unedited conversations remain accessible even after summarization and extraction. These can live in the source systems (Limitless, Fireflies, Dropbox) or be archived separately.

**Additional layers** (vector databases, knowledge graphs, etc.) should only be added if the human-readable knowledge base proves insufficient for semantic search or relationship tracking. Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

## Continuous Ingestion Patterns

### Incremental Indexing

The system watches directories and streams continuously rather than running periodic batch imports. When a new file appears or a meeting completes, ingestion happens within minutes. Agents work with current data, not yesterday's snapshot.

### Idempotent Processing

Ingestion can run multiple times on the same content without creating duplicates or corruption. If a conversation gets reprocessed because of a system restart, the result is the same. This allows safe retry logic and backfilling of historical data.

### Reverse Chronological Backfill

When ingesting historical data, start with the most recent and work backwards. Recent information matters more for current operations. If backfill takes weeks, agents can operate effectively with the last month while historical data gradually populates.

## Privacy and Partitioning

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system supports partitioned data stores per client or per project to prevent data bleed. If you're running this for multiple users or clients, each gets isolated storage. Sensitive data (therapy sessions, confidential client information) can be hosted separately from general operational data.

### Decay and Relevance Rules

Older commitments and suggestions get deprioritized unless recently referenced. The system surfaces likely stale items for review rather than acting on outdated information. Context windows prioritize recent, relevant information over comprehensive historical data.

### Privacy Controls

Privacy protection operates as the first line of defense. Content can be deleted before any other agent processes it. Sensitive topics can trigger automatic redaction. Voice commands like "delete the last 5 minutes" work immediately.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop

### Daily Review Cycles

Conservative daily review ensures LLM outputs get audited before autonomous action. Agents draft, humans approve. High-confidence operations may proceed automatically, but anything questionable gets flagged for human review.

### Visibility Dashboards

Humans can see what data was ingested, what facts were extracted, what actions were proposed. The system maintains transparency about what agents know and what they're doing with that knowledge.

## Success Metrics for Data Ingestion

Track these indicators to ensure the ingestion pipeline works:

- Percentage of new transcripts auto-processed within target time window
- Percentage of extracted action items automatically created as tasks
- Precision and recall for extracted facts and entities (target >80% after calibration)
- Coverage across data sources (are all sources being monitored?)
- Human correction rate (how often do humans need to fix agent extractions?)
- Agent confidence scores trending upward over time as patterns are learned

## Minimal Viable Implementation Path

Start simple and add complexity only when needed:

1. **Choose one data source** - Start with meeting transcripts (Fireflies) or conversations (Limitless)
2. **Build ingestion agent** - Parse content, extract commitments and facts
3. **Store in knowledge base** - Update Notion databases with extracted information
4. **Create tasks** - Generate project management tasks from commitments
5. **Validate quality** - Review agent extractions and measure accuracy
6. **Add sources incrementally** - Once one source works well, add the next

Only add vector databases or knowledge graphs when direct queries to your knowledge base prove insufficient. The best architecture is the simplest one that meets your needs.
